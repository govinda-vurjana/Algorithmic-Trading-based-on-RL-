# Development Time Log

Track your time spent on each part of the RL task development.

## Task Development

| Task | Time Spent | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Initial setup | 30 min | Setting up file structure, basic tools |
| Task design | 45 min | Writing prompt, defining requirements |
| Grading logic | 60 min | Implementing comprehensive grader |
| Testing & tuning | 90 min | Adjusting difficulty to hit target success rate |
| Documentation | 20 min | README, examples, comments |

**Total Development Time**: ~4 hours

## Testing Iterations

| Date | Pass Rate | Changes Made | Time |
|------|-----------|--------------|------|
| 2025-11-03 | 85% | Initial implementation - too easy | 15 min |
| 2025-11-03 | 45% | Added stricter grading criteria | 20 min |
| 2025-11-03 | 25% | Made requirements more challenging | 15 min |

## Notes

- Target success rate: 10-40% for effective RL training
- Most time spent on getting the difficulty right
- Grading logic is crucial - needs to be comprehensive but fair
- Consider edge cases and different solution approaches
